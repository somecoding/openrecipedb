# Open Recipe DB

## The Idea

The idea for ORDB was heavily inspired by OpenFoodFacts.

tldr; I want to create a public open database of recipes for everyone to (re-)use freely.

There are many forms of recipes. Some recipes are published by large cookbook companys or are published with a long intro text as a Blog Post. 
Others were written and shared on 'social media'-like plattforms. 

Yes - you can access and cook most of these recipes pretty easily, but they are basically privately owned content by a company. 
This makes it hard to analyze and work with this data on a variety on purposes. 
I want to create a public open database of recipes for everyone to (re-)use freely.
Ideally already existing OpenSource Cookbook applications could allow you to upload your and use other users recipes - as a shared RecipeDatabase between different software solutions.

For people who want to share their family recipes to the world. 
For translating into multiple languages without borders.
For scientists to work with.
